This directory contains examples of logical flow and conditionals for beginner to intermediate programmers.  

[Logic Flow & Conditionals -- youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qL-mEvHK-rg&t=0s) : the recording associated with this code can be viewed here

in this tutorial we cover basic patterns for controlling the flow of our program, including if/else, try/catch & switch statements.
1. basic if/else
2. handling invalid input
3. try/catch
4. parsing inside a try/catch
5. using loops and try/catch to ensure valid input before continuing
6. parsing strings in a try/catch loop
7. more parsing input in a try/catch loop
8. simple if/else parse loop
9. utilizing exceptions to perform conditional logic
10. exceptions in functions
11. truthy and falsy values
12. non-boolean comparisons
13. switch statements
